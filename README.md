## Introduction
This project was conceived as part of my postgraduate course in Data Engineering at PUC-Rio, focusing on three main pillars: databases, data warehouses and data lakes, and data management and governance. It represents a unique opportunity to apply the theoretical concepts learned in a practical setting, using real data from the Brazilian e-commerce market. I chose to focus on the e-commerce sector not only due to its relevance and explosive growth in recent years, but also because the data is readily available and does not present confidentiality issues. In addition to providing a platform to enhance my skills in data manipulation and analysis, this project also allows me to explore some of the emerging trends in data science and big data, including automation, cloud computing, and specific tools from GCP (Google Cloud Platform).
## Goal
The main objective of this project is to use data from Brazil's largest e-commerce platform, Olist, which were obtained through the Kaggle platform, to perform trend and sales performance analyses. Due to resource limitations (using the trial version of GCP), our scope of analysis will focus on:

1. Sales trend analysis, including sales volume, revenue, and shipping costs.
2. Sales performance analysis, including seller ratings and product category performance.
3. Customer reactions to delivery time.
